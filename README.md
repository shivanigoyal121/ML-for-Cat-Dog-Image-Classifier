# ML-for-Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier

<b>Problem Specification:</b> 
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning Cat/Dog image classifier.
Here, implementing a system to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. The dataset is available on: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. The dataset is comprised of 25,000 images of dogs and cats.
This is a binary classification problem. The images have significant variation in pose. Therefore, the goal is to build a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting the correct animal (cat or dog) in new unseen images.

This project is divided into three parts:

<b>1. Part A- Pre-procesing phase:</b>
In this phase, we will be focussing on preparing the dataset, i.e. loading, displaying, normalisation, resizing, dimension reduction (PCA), etc. 

<b>2. Part B- Training phase:</b>
In this phase, we have train the different machine learning algorithms using the pre-processed dataset comprised of the images and their corresponding labels split in train and development (a part of your training data you will use during the implementation).The test dataset will used to predict labels of unseen images.

<b>3. Part C- Optimization phase:</b>
In this phase, focuses on hyperparameter optimization on the final model.
